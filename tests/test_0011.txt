Here we want to make sure each whitespace-separated token follows one of a fixed set of regular expressions.
So far everything has only used the English alpha plus punctuation.
But we also want to allow Greek words like λόγος.
What we want to catch, though, is things like λόγoς where the penultimate character is actually the LATIN SMALL LETTER O even though it's hard to tell.
